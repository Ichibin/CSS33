            <h3>The key aspects of a fountain pen are:</h3>
            <span>The Nib: </span><p>The heart of the fountain pen, the nib, determines the line width and writing feel. Nibs are typically made of metal or gold and come in various sizes, from extra-fine to broad. The choice of nib depends on personal preference and writing style.</p>

            <span>Ink: </span> <p>Fountain pens use liquid ink, which is available in a wide range of colors and types. Traditional fountain pen ink is often made from dyes or pigments, while modern inks may contain additives for properties like water resistance or quick-drying.</p>

            <span>Maintenance: </span> <p>While fountain pens require more maintenance than ballpoint or rollerball pens, the effort is often rewarded with a superior writing experience. Regular cleaning and ink filling are essential to ensure optimal performance.</p>
